# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
  - images/heavensconnect_logo.png
  - images/heavensconnect_logo_flip.png
  - images/hc_logo_trans.png
  - images/purple-moon-heaven-sky-clouds.png
  - assets/animations/success.json
  - assets/animations/loading.json
  - assets/animations/loading2.json
  - assets/animations/warning.json
  - assets/animations/warning1.json
  - assets/icons/volunteer_heart_icon.svg
  - assets/icons/hc_logo_trans.svg

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Bold.ttf

          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
